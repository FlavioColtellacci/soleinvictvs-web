Eyebrow: 'PHILOSOPHY' — .section-eyebrow, Cinzel, .5rem, letter-spacing .55em, gold, uppercase, centered.\n2.

Rule: .title-rule — 60px × 1px, var(--gold), margin 0 auto 1.5rem.\n4. Sub: 'Ancient Stoic wisdom. Applied to modern life. No excuses. No shortcuts.' — .page-sub, .8rem, var(--text-muted), Cinzel, letter-spacing .15em, uppercase, centered.\n\n── THREE PILLARS SECTION ─────────────────────────────────────\nClass: .pillars-section .reveal\nPadding: 6rem 4rem\nMax-width: 1100px, margin: 0 auto\n\nSection header:\n  Eyebrow: 'THE FOUNDATION' — .section-eyebrow, centered, margin-bottom 4rem.\n  H2: 'THREE PILLARS OF THE UNCONQUERED LIFE' — .section-title, centered, margin-bottom 5rem.\n\nPillars grid: .pillars-grid-expanded — display grid, grid-template-columns: repeat(3,1fr), gap: 4rem.\n\nEach pillar: class .pillar-card\nStructure per pillar card:\n  1. Roman numeral: class .pillar-num — Cinzel 900, 3rem, rgba(201,168,76,.15), display block, margin-bottom 1.25rem.\n  2. Title: class .pillar-title-lg — Cinzel, .85rem, letter-spacing .3em, var(--text), margin-bottom .75rem, uppercase.\n  3. Latin subtitle: class .pillar-latin — Cormorant Garamond italic, 1rem, var(--gold), margin-bottom 1.5rem.\n  4. Body text: class .pillar-body — .82rem, var(--text-muted), line-height 2.1 — 3 sentences minimum, in brand voice.\n\nThree pillars content:\n\nPillar I:\n  Numeral: I\n  Title: PHILOSOPHY\n  Latin: Sapientia et Ratio\n  Body: 'Marcus Aurelius ruled an empire and still made time to examine himself. Seneca, one of the wealthiest men in Rome, wrote about the freedom found in voluntary poverty. Epictetus, a former slave, taught the most powerful men of his age how to think clearly. The Stoics were not theorists. They were practitioners. Their philosophy survived because it works — in the arena, in the market, and in the mind.'\n\nPillar II:\n  Numeral: II\n  Title: DISCIPLINE\n  Latin: Disciplina et Constantia\n  Body: 'Motivation is weather. It shows up uninvited and leaves without warning. Discipline is architecture — built deliberately, maintained daily, indifferent to how you feel in the morning. The Stoics called it the training of the will. Not the suppression of desire, but its redirection. Every day you enforce the standard, you add one more stone to the fortress.'\n\nPillar III:\n  Numeral: III\n  Title: COMMUNITY\n  Latin: Fraternitas in Virtute\n  Body: 'Rome did not build itself. The legions moved as one because every soldier held the line. We are building a community of men who hold the line — in their training, their finances, their relationships, and their character. No comfort culture. No empty validation. Just the shared pursuit of an unconquered life. The Legion is not for everyone. That is the point.'\n\n── FOUR VIRTUES SECTION ──────────────────────────────────────\nClass: .virtues-section\nBackground: var(--surface)\nPadding: 6rem 4rem\n\nSection header (same pattern as above):\n  Eyebrow: 'THE CARDINAL VIRTUES'\n  H2: 'THE FOUR PILLARS OF CHARACTER'\n  Both centered. Margin-bottom 5rem on H2.\n\nVirtues grid: .virtues-grid — display grid, grid-template-columns: repeat(2,1fr), gap: 2rem.\nMax-width: 900px, margin: 0 auto.\n\nEach virtue: class .virtue-card\nStyles: background var(--bg), border 1px solid rgba(201,168,76,.08), padding 2.5rem, transition border-color .4s.\n.virtue-card:hover { border-color: rgba(201,168,76,.2); }\n\nStructure per virtue card:\n  1. Latin name: class .virtue-name — var(--font-display), 1.4rem, letter-spacing .12em, var(--gold), margin-bottom .35rem.\n  2. English name: class .virtue-en — Cinzel, .5rem, letter-spacing .4em, var(--text-muted), uppercase, margin-bottom 1.25rem.\n  3. Definition: class .virtue-def — Cinzel, .7rem, letter-spacing .08em, var(--text), margin-bottom 1rem.\n  4. Body: class .virtue-body — .8rem, var(--text-muted), line-height 2, margin-bottom 1.5rem — 2 sentences.\n  5. Quote: class .virtue-quote — Cormorant Garamond italic, 1rem, var(--text), border-left 2px solid rgba(201,168,76,.3), padding-left 1rem, margin-top auto.\n  6. Quote attribution: class .virtue-attr — .55rem, Cinzel, letter-spacing .2em, var(--text-muted), display block, margin-top .5rem.\n\nFour virtues content:\n\nCard 1 — SAPIENTIA:\n  Latin: SAPIENTIA\n  English: WISDOM\n  Definition: 'The capacity to perceive what is true and act accordingly.'\n  Body: 'Wisdom is not intelligence. It is not information. It is the ability to see clearly and choose rightly when it matters most. The Stoics considered it the master virtue because all others flow from it.'\n  Quote: 'He is a wise man who does not grieve for the things which he has not, but rejoices for those which he has.'\n  Attribution: — Epictetus\n\nCard 2 — IUSTITIA:\n  Latin: IUSTITIA\n  English: JUSTICE\n  Definition: 'The commitment to act rightly toward others and toward the world.'\n  Body: 'Justice is not the law. The Stoics understood justice as an internal standard — the disposition to treat every person, in every circumstance, with the dignity they deserve. Your justice is most tested when no one is watching.'\n  Quote: 'Never esteem anything as of advantage to you that will make you break your word or lose your self-respect.'\n  Attribution: — Marcus Aurelius\n\nCard 3 — FORTITUDO:\n  Latin: FORTITUDO\n  English: COURAGE\n  Definition: 'The will to act rightly in the face of fear, pain, or opposition.'\n  Body: 'Courage is not the absence of fear. It is the decision that something else matters more. The Stoics trained for adversity before it arrived — through voluntary hardship, cold, hunger, and discomfort. What you rehearse, you become.'\n  Quote: 'You want to live, but do you know how to live? You are scared to die, and tell me, is the kind of life you lead really living?'\n  Attribution: — Seneca\n\nCard 4 — TEMPERANTIA:\n  Latin: TEMPERANTIA\n  English: MODERATION\n  Definition: 'The discipline to govern appetite, impulse, and excess.'\n  Body: 'Moderation is not weakness or half-measures. It is the Stoic science of limits — knowing how much food, how much pleasure, how much rest serves the higher standard and what begins to erode it. The man who masters himself masters everything.'\n  Quote: 'Moderation is a fatal thing. Nothing succeeds like excess — or, in this case, exactly the opposite.'\n  Attribution: — Epictetus · Discourses\n\n── FOUNDER SECTION ───────────────────────────────────────────\nClass: .founder-section .reveal\nPadding: 6rem 4rem\nMax-width: 800px, margin: 0 auto, text-align: center\n\nContents:\n\n1. Eyebrow: 'THE FOUNDER' — .section-eyebrow, centered, margin-bottom 3rem.\n\n2. Founder avatar:\n   Class: .founder-avatar\n   Markup: <img src='../brand_assets/sun_transparent.png' alt='Founder' class='founder-avatar'>\n   CSS: .founder-avatar { width: 120px; height: 120px; border-radius: 50%; border: 1px solid rgba(201,168,76,.3); display: block; margin: 0 auto 2rem; object-fit: cover; }\n   NOTE for operator: replace src='../brand_assets/sun_transparent.png' with real founder photo. The border-radius:50% crops it to a circle regardless of image aspect ratio. Recommended photo: square crop, min 240×240px.\n\n3. Founder name: class .founder-name — var(--font-display), clamp(1.4rem,3vw,2.2rem), letter-spacing .12em, var(--text), margin-bottom .5rem.\n   Placeholder text: 'THE FOUNDER'\n   NOTE for operator: replace 'THE FOUNDER' with your real name.\n\n4. Founder title: class .founder-title — Cinzel, .5rem, letter-spacing .4em, var(--gold), uppercase, margin-bottom 2.5rem.\n   Placeholder text: 'FOUNDER · SOLEINVICTVS'\n\n5. Gold rule: .title-rule, 60px, centered, margin 0 auto 2.5rem.\n\n6. Bio paragraphs: three <p> tags, each class .founder-bio\n   CSS: .founder-bio { font-size: .88rem; color: var(--text-muted); line-height: 2.1; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; text-align: left; max-width: 640px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; }\n\n   Placeholder paragraph 1:\n   'I built SOLEINVICTVS because the philosophy that changed my life had no home. Marcus Aurelius was writing to himself. Seneca was writing to a friend. Epictetus was speaking to a small room. None of them expected to be read two thousand years later. But the fact that we still read them tells you everything about the durability of what they were pointing at. I wanted to build something that pointed at the same thing — but for men living right now, in the world as it is.'\n\n   Placeholder paragraph 2:\n   'This is not a motivational brand. Motivation is a feeling, and feelings are unreliable. This is a discipline brand. The difference is that discipline works even when nothing inside you wants to. The Stoics built systems for exactly this — frameworks for the days when everything pulls you toward the easy path. The Fortress Protocol, the Virtue Audit, the Codex — every piece of this is a tool for building something they cannot take from you. The fortress is within.'\n\n   Placeholder paragraph 3:\n   'If you found this, you were looking for it. Something in you recognized that the current cultural conversation about strength and manhood is hollow. That the self-help industry is selling you comfort dressed up as growth. That real philosophy is harder, older, and more demanding — and also far more rewarding. Welcome to the Legion. We rise unconquered. Semper ad meliora.'\n\n   NOTE for operator: replace all three paragraphs with your real bio. Keep the same structure — three paragraphs, each 4-6 sentences. Brand voice: direct, philosophical, no hustle language.\n\n── NEWSLETTER CTA SECTION ────────────────────────────────────\nClass: .newsletter .reveal, id='newsletter'\nCopy the newsletter section from index.html exactly — same markup, CSS, and JS handleSignup() function.\nUse C-006 token names for any token references (var(--surface) for background, etc.).\n\n── SHARED FOOTER HTML ────────────────────────────────────────\n(same canonical footer as all pages)\n\n── RESPONSIVE ────────────────────────────────────────────────\n@media (max-width: 900px):\n  .pillars-section, .virtues-section, .founder-section { padding: 5rem 1.75rem; }\n  .pillars-grid-expanded { grid-template-columns: 1fr; gap: 3rem; }\n  .virtues-grid { grid-template-columns: 1fr; gap: 1.5rem; }\n  .page-header { padding: 10rem 1.75rem 3rem; }\n  .newsletter { padding: 5rem 1.75rem; }\n  .newsletter-form { flex-direction: column; }\n\n── JS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nScroll reveal IntersectionObserver (copy from index.html).\nhandleSignup() function (copy from index.html).\nNo other JS.\n\n── SWAP INSTRUCTIONS (HTML COMMENTS) ────────────────────────\nAdd an HTML comment block at the very top of <body>, before the nav, with the following text:\n\n<!-- OPERATOR SWAP INSTRUCTIONS\n     Avatar: replace img src='../brand_assets/sun_transparent.png' with real photo path.\n     Name: replace 'THE FOUNDER' in .founder-name with real name.\n     Bio: replace the three .founder-bio paragraphs with real copy.\n     No layout or CSS changes required for any of the above swaps.\n-->"
